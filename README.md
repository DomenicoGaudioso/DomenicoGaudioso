### Ciao! 👋

I'm a civil engineer passionate about structures, from design to monitoring. In my world of concrete and steel, I also carve out space for my love of computer science, especially using Python.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on projects involving the design and monitoring of bridges.
- 🌱 I'm constantly enhancing my computer science skills, with a particular focus on Python and its engineering applications.
- 👯 I'm eager to collaborate on projects that integrate civil engineering and computer science, creating effective and innovative solutions.
- 💬 Ask me anything about structural design, bridge monitoring, or software development for civil engineering.
- 🛠️ I use Grasshopper and Rhinoceros (🦏 + 🦗) for parametric design approaches and to experiment with innovative solutions.
- 🏗️ I am a certified BIM Specialist with experience using Tekla and Revit, with a perspective also oriented towards the OpenBIM community.
- 📫 You can reach out to me at dome.gaudioso@gmail.com to discuss interesting projects or simply exchange ideas.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love solving complex problems and finding creative solutions!

I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts in civil engineering, computer science, and OpenBIM. Together, we can build something extraordinary!
